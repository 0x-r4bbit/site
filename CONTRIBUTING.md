### Home Page

To develop the home page, use `npm run dev`.

### CSS

CSS is processed using [postcss](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) and you need to build it (it's `.gitignored`). To do this, run `npm run build:css`.

If you're going to work on the css, you can run `npm run dev:css` and it will watch the file for changes and rebuild.

### Episodes

I've hacked together a pretty crazy way to build these files. I'm sure
there's a much better way to do this. But what we've got works pretty
well. If you're working on a specific episode (for example, the first
episode), simply run:

```
npm run dev:episode -- episodes/2015-12-09
```

This will start nodemon watching your file system for changes and
recompiling your page on changes. No hot reloading or anything. Yes, I
have no idea what I'm doing. (protip, you may also want to look into [npm-quick-run](npm.im/npm-quick-run))

I've added a [plop](http://npm.im/plop) generator for adding new
episodes. In the root directory, simply enter

```
plop episode
```

Follow the prompts and it will generate the episode file for you.

### Podbean description

You can generate the description for the podbean podcast like so:

```
npm run description -- episodes/2015-12-09
```

`pbcopy` is available on OSX if you want to pipe the output to your
clipboard (recommended)

## Deploying

We deploy with [surge.sh](https://surge.sh) automatically with
[travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/javascriptair/site). Once stuff gets
into master, travis builds it and deploys it to surge. That's it! It's
magic!
