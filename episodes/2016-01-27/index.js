  description: `
    Microsoft has been making some pretty awesome
    moves in the world of open source recently.
    At JSConf in early December, it was announced that
    Chakra, Microsoft's JavaScript Engine
    that powers the Microsoft Edge browser
    (with better support for ES6 than babel or Chrome),
    will be open sourced. Join us as we talk about
    Chakra with some of the subject matter experts!
